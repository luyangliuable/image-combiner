<!-- markdown-toc end -->

A simple Rust program that overlays one image on top of another. The program takes in two image file paths as command line arguments and generates a new image with the overlay. No external dependencies or compilation required, simply run the binary file to use. Perfect for quickly adding a watermark or logo to a batch of images.


## How to use

1. Go into root directory

2. Run command
```shell
cargo run first_image second_image output
```
